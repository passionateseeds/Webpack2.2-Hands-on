# webpack 2.2 hands-on tutorial

## Goal of this hands-on
This is a part of my webpack learning journey, we wrote this documents to help myself re-formulate what I have learnt, clarify my thinking.
This hands-on is step-by-steps configure webpack as well as detail of what problems we are trying to solve.
My advise is stick with this hands-on, doing by yourself, look at [the webpack official docs][twod]  for clarification.

The main function of web browser is to present web resource we choose. The web resource is usually
  * An HTML file which describes content of elements
