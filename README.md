# webpack 2.2 hands-on tutorial

## Goal of this hands-on
This is a part of my webpack learning journey, we wrote this documents to help myself re-formulate what I have learnt, clarify my thinking.
This hands-on is step-by-steps configure webpack as well as detail of what problems we are trying to solve.
My advise is stick with this hands-on, doing by yourself, look at [the webpack official docs][twod]  for clarification.

## chapter01. initial project configuration
The main function of web browser is to present web resource we choose. The web resource is usually
  * A HTML file which describes content of elements
  * CSS files which defines the look and feel of a particular elements
  * JavaScript makes HTML page more dynamic

To initialize project, I create `index.html` file, `main.css` file and `bundle.js` file in `build` folder. `build` folder is a package we will deploy to web server.
